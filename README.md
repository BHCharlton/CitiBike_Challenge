# NYC Citi Bike Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis
We will be using Pandas and Tableau to work with NYC Citi Bike rider information that is available to the public for data analysis.  With the intention of using the results to assist in starting up a similar Citi Bike service in Des Moines, IA then we must be cautious when analyzing the data.  While the results should provide very useful information for making good start-up business decisions, they are specific to New York City, which is very different than Des Moines.  Thus, they must be interpreted through that lens when making important decisions.

After making some data updates with Pandas, Tableau will be used to create visualizations that will help interpret these key points:
* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
